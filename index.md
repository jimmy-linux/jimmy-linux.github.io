You have arrived at my personal website homepage. This means you'll have to read
a little about myself now. I'll tell you about what I did first, then about my
mindset, and then about my background.

## Projects
I love doing my personal projects. Whenever some idea I'm excited about poped
into my mind I develop it in my `Vinote` and jump straight into implementing it
in real life. And the most exciting thing is when I actually use the project in
my everyday life. Here are the projects I enjoy using:

- [Vinote](projects/vinote) - a deep note taking system, plugin for neovim.
- [Querypath](projects/querypath) - makes working with files in the console more efficient.
- [Keyflux](projects/keyflux) - my most ergonomic keyboard layout for laptops.
- [Focusbynum](projects/focusbynum) - the fastest way to access the target window in dwm.
- [Dwm](projects/dwm) - my version of dwm.

Click on any of them and check them out.

## What a good software means to me
I have my own definition of what a good software is:
- Free (as in freedom).
- Open source.
- Light on resources.
- Keyboard-driven.
- Having a CLI client.
- No decorations.
- No animations.

## What hardware I use
ThinkPads are great. They have a really good integration with Arch Linux. And,
their keyboards are of high quality, like the laptops themselves. Mine's T480.

Also, going to make my own keyboard which will replace the built-in ThinkPad's
keyboard.

As for a mouse - I use just trackpoint or a trackpad. Mouse is just too far away
from the keyboard.

## Lifestyle
I always try to keep my lifestyle active. The first thing in the morning should
be movement. Recovery should be only by movement. Excercising is beyond
negotiation. If commuting somewhere then only by bicycle. Also, I try to connect
with people as much as possible, and only IRL if possible.

## My background
I'm Dmytro Rohiv, born in Rivne, Ukraine. Moved to Kyiv in 2025. First touched
GNU/Linux in 2020. Always loved to customize everything to my needs. Was a fan
of visually minimal but feature-rich interfaces.
