You have arrived at my personal website homepage. This means you'll have to read
a little about myself now. I'll tell you about what I did first, then about my
mindset, and then about my background.

## My personal projects
Here I'll list my personal hobby projects. The links to each of them will be
left after the description of each one.

### Vinote
This is my note taking system. It's made as a plugin for neovim, and in some way
intersects with orgmode, although lacks a bunch of features to be called an
alternative to orgmode.

### Querypath
The fork of the `zoxide` cli tool, which extends its functionality to use with
any kind of files with any kind of cli command which uses file path as its
argument.

### Keyflux
The best in the world (for me) keyboard layout for use on regular laptops. It's
implemented on `kanata`, and was developed on a standard physical thinkpad
keyboard layout. Uses multiple access levels to access Fn keys, spec symbols and
digits as well as convenient modkeys placement.

### Focusbynum
A little patch for `dwm` which allows you to get an instant access to the target
window without endlessly Alt-Tab'bing and searching for the window.

## My mindset
Here you'll read about how I think and about the base on which I do most of my
life decisions.

### Software
#### Freedom
I try to only use free software (is in freedom). I'm a fan of the philosophy of
the freedom to study, modify and share.

#### Weight
I always try to find and use the simplest and most optimized on hardware
software. I don't need any fancy animations and decorations-I just need a lot of
features with the convenient access from keyboard.

#### Keyboard-drivenness
I love it when I can do all of my work without lifting my hands off my keyboard
with my lovely Keyflux. The more I use keyboard for my daily actions the more my
mechanical memory is trained to do those things, which leads to automated
actions before even fully finished thought.

#### CLI
CLI a.k.a. the shell a.k.a. the console is everything. I use the console most of
the time wherever I can. Just because it's scriptable, especially if the tools
aren't interactive. Because everything I do in the console can be put into a script,
aliased, looped, wrapped into a function, or put into the .\*rc file.

### Hardware
I use ThinkPad T480. I chose this one because some people say it's *the last
good thinkpad*. And I think I'll be using ThinkPads long after this one, because
they are really good. I like how they can be easily upgraded and customized.
Also, for this same reason I use mikrotik routers: you can do literally
everything on them-even run docker containers on them.

#### Keyboard
Also, I'd like to make my own physical keyboard. This project is already
described, so going to implement it in the near future.

#### Mouse
What's a mouse?..

### Lifestyle
I like to feel good. That's why I try to keep my mental and physical health in a
good shape. I do sport regularly, eat healthy, rest enough, work on my hobbies,
if recovery then only physically active, read books. Although it's far from
consistent.
Also, love to make new connections. So feel free to text me. The links are in
the end of this page.
